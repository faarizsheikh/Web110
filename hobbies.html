            <h2 class = "hobbies_h2">Clubs:</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am not involved in any club. However, I used to be in a drama club in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, at Aden Bowman Collegiate,
                where I played the role of the villain Bobo in <em>"The History of Breathing,"</em> a silent killer part of a genocide group.</p>

            <h2 class = "hobbies_h2">Interests:</h2>
            <p>I like mentoring my buddies, as I'm always here for them when they need me. I encourage them to keep up with trying to reach their goals.
                Also, I help them with conflicts and try to help with their studies as best I can.</p><br/<br/>
            <p>I am interested in computer programming because I have obtained skills in it and want to become a programmer. Also, I am interested in religion
                because it matters to me and is what I value. I am also interested in psychology because it is about humans and the mind.</p>

            <h2 class = "hobbies_h2">Hobbies:</h2>
            <p>I like computer programming, since it is one of my skills. I know HTML/CSS, JS (JavaScript), and Python, and I look forward to
                learning more computer languages like C, C++, C# (C-Sharp), Lua, Swift, Ruby, and R.</p>
            <p>I often spend my free time playing video games that are action or horror ( like FNAF, Granny, and Roblox SAKTKIA51).
                FNAF (Five Nights at Freddy's) is a horror game where you are trying to survive at a pizzeria where you work as a nightguard from 12 to 6 am,
                and the animatronics attempt to kill you. You try to avoid them using lights, doors, and masks (depending on the game). It has multiple games,
                interesting lore and a story about how it all began. I spend my time mostly playing FNAF than the other games, as I enjoy the eerie atmosphere
                and the lore. I also enjoy listening to fan-made music on the game.</p>

            <h2 class = "hobbies_h2">Activities:</h2>
            <p>I like playing cricket because it's fun and enjoyed in my country, Pakistan. I also like basketball, because it is fun and makes me quite active.
                I enjoy tricking people with the ball, where they try to get it when I act like I'm about to throw it or when they run to where I turn.
                Also, I like baseball because it's fun to bat and run, similar to cricket, except we need to run in circles to the safe spots before they
                throw the ball, aiming at the spots to get the people running out.</p><br/<br/>
            <p>I like performing tabligh because it helps you share knowledge about your religion or the sect you belong to and receive information about
                other religions or their sects, even sects within your religion.
                Currently, my focus is on other Muslims (like Sunnis, Shi`as, Brelvis, Ahle Hadith, Deobandis, and Wahabis)
                because they oppose and make false allegations against Islam Ahmadiyya.</p>
