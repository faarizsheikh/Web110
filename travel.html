            <h2>Pakistan — my birthplace:</h2>
            <h3 class = "travel_h3">Lahore:</h3>
            <p>I was born in Lahore, Pakistan, where I went to nursery and kindergarten. I don't remember much about Lahore because I was young.</p>

            <h3 class = "travel_h3">Rabwah, Sialkot, Islamabad:</h3>
            <p>We also visited cities like Rabwah, Sialkot, and Islamabad because some of our family members lived there. Rabwah is a place of worship,
                and Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan. We also went to Murray for a picnic.</p>

            <h2>Canada — where I was raised mostly:</h2>
            <h3 class = "travel_h3">Toronto:</h3>
            <p>When my family and I first came to Canada, we moved to Toronto and lived with my grandparents for some time, before moving to Saskatoon.
                we have revisited Toronto multiple times because some of my family members lives there.</p>

            <h3 class = "travel_h3">Saskatoon:</h3>
            <p>We lived in Saskatoon from 2011 to 2021, where I went to Sutherland Elementary School until 2014, and then we moved to another area in Saskatoon,
                where I went to École Alvin Buckwold School. I also went to Aden Bowman Collegiate from grade nine to eleven.</p>

            <h3 class = "travel_h3">Vancouver:</h3>
            <p>We visited Vancouver a few times to meet my cousin and her family.</p>

            <h3 class = "travel_h3">Windsor:</h3>
            <p>I moved to Windsor with my family in 2021 and currently live here. My dad works as a truck driver and goes to the United States for his job,
                the same job he had in Saskatoon, but we're closer to the border now. I went to Tecumseh Vista Academy, finished twelfth grade and graduated.
                Then, I went to St. Clair College to study Computer Programming, which I am doing today.</p>

            <h2 class = "other">Other places I've been:</h2>
            <p>I have also visited the UK to meet my family — most of my maternal family live there. I also had the chance to see Big Ben and sat on a
                double-decker bus multiple times.</p><br />
            <p>Also, I have visited the US with my family multiple times for shopping and enjoyment. The first time we visited was because we had to cross
                the border of US to come to Windsor from Saskatoon.</p>

            <h2 class = "other">Places I wish to visit/travel:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mecca & Madina: Holy places for Muslims.</li>
                <li>France: Just for fun; want to see the Eiffel Tower.</li>
                <li>Mexico: Just for fun.</li>
